[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LearningByExample/ParallelTest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LearningByExample/ParallelTest)
## info
This is a small example for testing parallel stream and functional programming

The example itself is run using test:

```shell
$ mvn test -P slowTests
```
To just run the normal unit test:
```shell
$ mvn test
```
or
```shell
$ mvn test -P fastTests
```
